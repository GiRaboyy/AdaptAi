Ок — вот **обновлённый PROMPT** с учётом правок:

* **“Вернуться позже” убираем** (всё через “Мои курсы” + resume).
* **Создание трека и редактор** — **внутри библиотеки курсов куратора** (клик по курсу → детали/редактор).
* В Drill/проверках при ошибке показываем: **причину**, **правильный ответ/эталон**, и **насколько ошибся** (оценка/скор).

## PROMPT (Add Drill Mode + Real Analytics from scratch inside ADAPT — Russian UI, no “Return later” page)

You are a **Product Lead + Senior UX/UI Designer + QA Lead**. The current ADAPT app is missing two core pillars: **Drill Mode** and **Analytics** (they do not exist at all). Your task is to add them end-to-end and reshape the product so it fully satisfies the core Jobs.

### 1) MVP must-have outcomes (non-negotiable)

Deliver a working product where:

* Employees complete short lessons with **quizzes + open answers + roleplay**.
* **Drill Mode** exists and triggers automatically on mistakes.
* Curators have **real analytics** based on actual employee actions (no placeholders).
* UI is fully in **Russian**, with **Russian TTS narration** on button.
* Navigation is safe: **Back** + **Resume**; skipping “return later” page is NOT required.

### 2) Core Jobs (what this MVP must satisfy)

**Curator Jobs**

* Generate training quickly based on materials.
* Identify gaps early and reduce repeated newbie questions.
* See measurable results and “needs practice” areas per employee.

**Employee Jobs**

* Short steps, easy to finish.
* Immediate feedback and repetition when wrong (Drill).
* Voice support (listen + optionally answer by voice).

### 3) Build the required structure (add missing sections)

**Employee**

* **Обзор**
* **Мои курсы** (acts as library + resume hub)
* **Профиль**
* **Настройки**

**Curator**

* **Мои курсы/треки (Библиотека)** ← this is the main place
* **Аналитика**
* **Профиль**
* **Настройки**

### 4) Curator Library-first UX (creation + editor inside library)

Curator’s “Мои курсы/треки” must include:

* A clear **“+ Создать трек”** button in the library header
* Course cards showing: title, short description, join code (copy), enrollments, avg progress

**Create Track Flow (from library)**

* Minimal wizard/modal:

  * Title + optional description
  * KB upload (multiple files: PDF, DOC/DOCX, images) + paste text fallback
  * Toggle: “Строго по базе знаний (не выдумывать)”
  * Generate
* After generation, new course appears in library and opens **Course Details**.

**Course Details (opened by clicking a course card)**
Tabs:

1. **Обзор**
2. **Редактор**
3. **Сотрудники**
4. **Материалы (База знаний)**

**Редактор (mandatory)**
Curator can:

* Edit lesson titles
* Edit steps:

  * MCQ: question + options + correct answer + explanation
  * Open: question + rubric + ideal answer
  * Roleplay: scenario prompt + rubric
* Reorder steps
* Delete steps
* Add a new step manually
* Save + Preview as employee

### 5) Drill Mode — must be implemented (P0)

Drill Mode is reinforcement linked to “skills/topics” tags.

**Definition**

* Each Quiz/Open/Roleplay step has a tag (e.g., “Возражения”, “Активное слушание”).
* When the employee answers incorrectly:

  1. Show compact feedback including:

     * **Почему это ошибка** (reason)
     * **Как правильно** (correct answer / ideal response)
     * **Насколько ошибся** (error distance score)
  2. Immediately trigger a **Drill attempt**: a similar question on the same tag.
  3. Allow max **2 drill retries**.
  4. If still incorrect: mark tag as **“Нужно повторить”** and continue.

**“Насколько ошибся” (error distance)**

* For MCQ: show “Выбрано: X, Верно: Y” + confidence message, and a simple score:

  * 0% / 50% / 100% is OK for MVP (or 0–10 scale)
* For open answers/roleplay: show:

  * score 0–10
  * highlight missing key points (2–4 bullet points)
  * 1–2 example phrases to improve

**Employee visibility**

* During lesson: “Мини-дрилл (1/2)” indicator
* After drill: “Закрепили ✅” or “Отмечено: нужно повторить”

### 6) Real Analytics — must be built (P0)

Analytics must be computed from real tracking events/records.

**Curator analytics must show**
Track-level:

* joined employees count (by join code)
* completion %
* last activity distribution
* average quiz accuracy
* average open/roleplay score (0–10)
* top “Нужно повторить” tags/topics
* drop-off points (where users stop)

Employee-level:

* timeline: steps done + incorrect + drill triggered
* accuracy trend
* needs repeat tags list
* final summary:

  * readiness level
  * key gaps
  * recommended drills/next steps

**No fake metrics.** If no data, show empty states.

### 7) Lesson player UX (must support drill + safe navigation)

* Full-width lesson screen, short text (2–4 lines).
* Header: progress bar + “Шаг 3/12” + toggles:

  * 🔊 Озвучка: Вкл/Выкл
* Bottom actions:

  * **Назад**
  * Primary: **Проверить / Далее / Отправить**
* Resume behavior:

  * “Мои курсы” shows each course with progress and a **Continue** CTA that always works.

### 8) Voice (Russian) — must exist

* Each step has “🔊 Озвучить” button (Russian TTS).
* Open answer + roleplay support voice input (push-to-talk).
* Must not overwrite typed input.
* Settings: “Озвучка по умолчанию”.

### 9) KB upload (minimum)

KB upload supports multi-file:

* PDF + DOC/DOCX + images (JPG/PNG)
* If some format parsing not available: show clear message and allow paste text fallback.
  Do not break generation flow.

### 10) UI/visual consistency (Russian UI)

* Entire UI in Russian: menus, buttons, errors, headings.
* Pleasant green accent consistent across auth, dashboards, lesson screens.
* Add empty states, loading states, and toasts.
* No dead clicks, no silent failures.

### 11) Acceptance checklist (must pass)

1. Curator library has “Создать трек” and clicking course opens Course Details with tabs.
2. Editor exists inside course details and saving changes works.
3. Employee “Мои курсы” is the hub: list courses + progress + Continue always works.
4. Drill Mode triggers on wrong answers and shows:

   * why wrong
   * correct answer
   * how wrong (score/distance)
5. Curator analytics shows real joined employees and real progress/drill data.
6. Russian TTS works via button; voice input works where required.

**Final rule:** prioritize P0: Drill Mode + Real Analytics + Library-first curator UX + strong feedback on mistakes. Everything else is secondary.
