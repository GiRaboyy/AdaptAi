You are a Product Lead + Senior UX/UI Designer + QA Lead. Your task is to audit and fix the existing ADAPT web app so it matches the product promise and core Jobs. Deliver an end-to-end working MVP for mid-market SMB employees and curators.

0) Product context (do not change)

ADAPT is an AI onboarding + training platform that creates individualized training tracks based on a curator’s knowledge base (files/text). Employees complete short lessons (quizzes + open answers + roleplay). The system automatically reinforces weak areas with Drill Mode, and curators see real analytics from actual employee actions.

1) AS-IS (current problems you must fix)

Audit the running app and fix these issues (no placeholders):

Course generation is wrong: uploading a large knowledge base creates a tiny course (e.g., 3 questions). It must produce multi-module training that covers all major topics from the knowledge base.

No Drill Mode at all (missing pillar).

No real Analytics at all (missing pillar). Current metrics are absent or fake.

Navigation/UX issues:

Missing “Back / Home / Resume” behavior.

Users can get stuck, dead clicks, silent failures.

No ability to skip voice question and return later / or at least safely continue and revisit weak topics via Drill (see TO-BE).

Role separation is unclear:

Need clear split of Curator vs Employee areas.

Role switching must be predictable (ideally via profile/settings, but not breaking flows).

Auth bugs:

If user already exists and tries to register, system must show: “Пользователь уже зарегистрирован. Войдите.” (not “you are authorized”).

Login should never cause 404/redirection glitches.

KB upload breaks (PDF upload errors). Must support multi-file (PDF/DOC/DOCX/images) with clear fallbacks.

UI style inconsistent: too many borders/frames, inconsistent colors; must be clean and modern with a consistent pleasant green accent like the landing.

Russian UX requirement not fully met: entire UI must be Russian, including buttons, errors, empty states.

Voice is unreliable or missing:

Need Russian TTS “Speak” button on each step.

Voice input must not overwrite typed input.

2) TO-BE (non-negotiable outcomes)

Deliver a working product where:

Employee can:

Join courses via join code.

See “Мои курсы” library with progress and Continue that always works.

Complete lessons with:

Quiz (single/multi choice)

Open answer

Roleplay (sales practice)

Get immediate feedback on mistakes and be routed into Drill Mode automatically.

Use voice:

🔊 Озвучить (Russian TTS) on each step.

Optional 🎤 Голосовой ввод for open/roleplay (push-to-talk).

Navigate safely:

Назад and Продолжить always work.

No dead ends; no silent failures.

Curator can:

Create training quickly based on knowledge base.

Have a Library-first UX: “Мои курсы/треки” is the main place.

Generate a multi-module course from KB and then edit it.

See real analytics based on employee actions (not placeholders).

Identify gaps early: “Нужно повторить” topics per employee and track.

3) IA / Navigation structure (must implement)
Employee side menu:

Обзор

Мои курсы (main hub)

Профиль

Настройки

Curator side menu:

Мои курсы/треки (Library — MAIN)

Аналитика

Профиль

Настройки

Side menu must be:

visible on all internal pages

collapsible

consistent styling

4) Curator Library-first UX (create + editor inside library)

Curator “Мои курсы/треки” must include:

Header with CTA: “+ Создать трек”

Course cards showing:

Название

Короткое описание

Join code (copy)

Кол-во сотрудников (enrollments)

Средний прогресс

Последняя активность

Create Track flow (from library)

A minimal modal/wizard:

Название + (опц.) описание

Загрузка базы знаний:

multi-file: PDF, DOC/DOCX, images (JPG/PNG)

paste-text fallback

Toggle: “Строго по базе знаний (не выдумывать)”

Button: “Сгенерировать трек”
After generation:

New course appears in library

Auto-open Course Details

Course Details (click card → open)

Tabs:

Обзор

Редактор (mandatory)

Сотрудники

Материалы (База знаний)

Редактор (must work)

Curator can:

Edit module titles

Edit lessons/steps:

MCQ: question, options, correct, explanation, tag(topic)

Open: question, rubric, ideal answer, tag(topic)

Roleplay: scenario, rubric, ideal phrases, tag(topic)

Reorder steps

Delete steps

Add new step manually

Save

Preview as employee (“Посмотреть как сотрудник”)

5) Multi-module course generation (critical fix)

When KB is large, do NOT create 3 questions.
You MUST generate:

Course → Modules (themes) → Lessons → Steps/questions
Rules:

Cover all major topics from the KB

Each module must have multiple steps

Keep steps short and easy (2–4 lines max per prompt)

Use tags/topics to connect mistakes to Drill Mode

If “Strict KB” is enabled:

The AI must not invent facts outside KB

If KB lacks info: respond “нет данных в базе знаний” and escalate to curator (see Q&A)

6) Lesson player UX (full width, short, clear)

Lesson screen must be:

full-width content area (with responsive layout)

short text (2–4 lines per step)
Header:

progress bar

“Шаг X/Y”

toggle: “Озвучка: Вкл/Выкл”

button: “🔊 Озвучить”
Bottom:

Назад

Primary action changes: “Проверить / Далее / Отправить”
No dead clicks.

7) Drill Mode (P0, must implement end-to-end)

Definition:

Each step has a tag/topic (e.g., “Возражения”, “Активное слушание”).
Trigger:

If employee answers incorrectly:

show compact feedback:

Почему это ошибка

Как правильно

Насколько ошибся (distance score)

immediately launch a Drill attempt: a similar question of same tag

allow max 2 drill retries

if still incorrect: mark tag as “Нужно повторить” and continue

Distance scoring (MVP acceptable):

MCQ: show “Выбрано: X, Верно: Y” and score 0/50/100 or 0–10

Open/Roleplay:

score 0–10

missing key points (2–4 bullets)

1–2 example phrases to improve

Employee visibility:

“Мини-дрилл (1/2)” indicator

After drill: “Закрепили ✅” or “Отмечено: нужно повторить”

8) Real Analytics (P0, must be real, no placeholders)

Analytics must be computed from actual recorded actions:

joins via join code

step completion

incorrect attempts

drill triggers

scores and tags

Curator analytics must show:

Track-level:

joined employees count

completion %

last activity distribution

average quiz accuracy

average open/roleplay score (0–10)

top “Нужно повторить” tags/topics

drop-off points (where users stop)

Employee-level (per course):

timeline: steps done + incorrect + drill triggered

accuracy trend

needs repeat tags list

final summary:

readiness level

key gaps

recommended drills/next steps

Empty states:

If no data: show clean empty states, no fake numbers.

9) Q&A escalation to curator (must exist)

Employees can ask questions in-app (assistant).
Rules:

If answer exists in KB (strict mode): answer with KB-based response.

If KB does not contain the answer:

Say: “В базе знаний нет ответа. Я отправил вопрос куратору.”

Create a curator-visible item (in “Вопросы/обращения” or inside course “Сотрудники/Обзор” section).
Curator can reply; employee sees answer in the course context.

10) Voice (Russian) — must be stable

Every step has “🔊 Озвучить” button using Russian voice.

Open answer + roleplay: push-to-talk voice input.

Voice input must never overwrite typed text: append or fill only when input is empty.

Settings:

“Озвучка по умолчанию: Вкл/Выкл”

11) KB upload (minimum acceptable)

Supports multi-file: PDF + DOC/DOCX + JPG/PNG.

If parsing fails: show clear message and allow “Вставить текст вручную”.

Generation flow must not break.

12) UI/Visual (must match the landing vibe)

Goal: simple, clean, modern — not heavy borders.
Requirements:

Consistent pleasant green accent across auth, dashboards, lessons.

Reduce outlines/borders; use spacing, subtle shadows, soft corners.

Add loading states, toasts, error states in Russian.

No silent failures — always show what happened.

13) Auth fixes (must pass QA)

Register with existing email → show “Пользователь уже зарегистрирован. Войдите.”

Login should never show 404 glitch.

Proper error messages for wrong password, invalid email, etc.

After login: direct routing to correct home depending on role.

14) Acceptance checklist (must pass before done)

✅ Curator Library has “Создать трек” and clicking a course opens details with tabs.
✅ Editor exists, saving works, preview works.
✅ Employee “Мои курсы” is a working hub: progress + Continue always works.
✅ Drill Mode triggers on wrong answers and shows reason + correct + “how wrong”.
✅ Analytics shows real joined employees and real progress/drill data.
✅ Russian TTS works via button; voice input works where needed.
✅ KB upload supports multi-file; failures have clear fallback.
✅ UI is fully Russian and visually consistent (green accent, minimal borders).
✅ No dead clicks; no silent failures; safe Back/Resume everywhere.

Priority rule

P0 first: Multi-module course generation + Drill Mode + Real Analytics + Library-first Curator UX + stable navigation + auth correctness. Everything else is secondary.
