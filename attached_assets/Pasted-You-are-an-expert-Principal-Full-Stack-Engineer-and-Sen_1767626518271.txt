You are an expert Principal Full-Stack Engineer and Senior Product Designer.
Your goal is to build "ADAPT" — a premium AI-powered onboarding platform.

**Product Reference & Vibe:**
- **Visuals:** "Apple Minimal". Heavy use of whitespace, large typography (SF Pro style), rounded corners (20px), soft shadows, blur effects.
- **Interactions:** "Duolingo-like" smoothness. Instant feedback, progress bars, satisfying completion animations.
- **Core Feature:** "Dailo-like" simulation. Employees use voice to answer situational questions; if they fail, they enter "Drill Mode" (practice loop).

**Technical Stack (Strict Constraints):**
1.  **Frontend:** React, Vite, Tailwind CSS, Framer Motion (for all transitions), Lucide React.
2.  **Backend:** Node.js with Express.
    - **SECURITY RULE:** Do NOT use the Supabase Client on the frontend. Do NOT expose `anon` keys. All DB operations must go through the Node.js backend.
3.  **Database:** PostgreSQL (use `pg` or `drizzle-orm`).
4.  **AI:** Connect to an external Ollama instance via HTTP.
    - Env: `OLLAMA_BASE_URL` (default to a mock if missing).
    - **Mocking:** If the API key/URL is missing, you MUST mock the AI response with realistic JSON data so the UI is fully testable immediately.
5.  **Voice:** Use the native Browser Web Speech API (`speechSynthesis` for TTS, `speechRecognition` for STT). No external paid APIs.

**Database Schema (Create these tables):**
- `users` (id, email, password_hash, role: 'curator'|'employee', name)
- `tracks` (id, curator_id, title, raw_knowledge_base_text, join_code)
- `steps` (id, track_id, type: 'content'|'quiz'|'roleplay', content_json, order_index)
- `enrollments` (id, user_id, track_id, progress_pct, is_completed)
- `drill_attempts` (id, user_id, step_id, is_correct, transcript, timestamp)

**CORE FLOWS TO IMPLEMENT (In Order):**

### 1. Public Landing Page (Apple Style)
- **Header:** Minimal, sticky. Logo "ADAPT". Buttons: "Demo", "Login".
- **Hero:** Big H1: "The AI Mentor for Onboarding". Subtext: "No boring PDFs. Train with voice, drills, and feedback."
- **Visuals:** Clean cards, lots of "air" between sections.
- **CTA:** "Try Demo" (Leads to Login).

### 2. Authentication & Roles
- **Login/Register:** Simple form.
- **Role Logic:**
    - **Curator:** Redirect to `/curator/dashboard`.
    - **Employee:** Redirect to `/app/join`.

### 3. Curator Flow: The "2-Minute Magic"
- **Create Track:**
    - Input: Title + Large Text Area ("Paste your internal docs here").
    - Action: "Generate Training".
    - **Backend Logic (Crucial):** The backend calls the AI (or Mock). The AI must convert the text into a JSON array of steps:
        - `type: 'content'` (Short theory, max 3 sentences).
        - `type: 'quiz'` (Multiple choice).
        - `type: 'roleplay'` (Open question: "A client is angry about X. What do you say?").
- **Share:** Display a large 6-digit `join_code`.

### 4. Employee Flow: The "Immersive Player" (The Main Feature)
- **Join:** Enter code -> Load Track.
- **Player UI:** Full screen, no distractions. One card centered.
- **Step Types:**
    - **Content:** Text + "Speaker" icon (Click to read aloud via TTS). Button: "Got it".
    - **Quiz:** Select option. Immediate Green/Red feedback.
    - **Roleplay (Voice):**
        - UI: Question text + Large Pulsing Microphone Button.
        - Interaction: User holds/clicks Mic -> Speaks -> Text appears (STT).
        - Feedback: AI grades the answer (0-10).
- **DRILL MODE LOGIC (Must Implement):**
    - If user answers **WRONG** (Quiz or Roleplay score < 6/10):
        1.  Do NOT advance to the next step.
        2.  Show an "Assistant" avatar/icon.
        3.  Show a **Hint** derived from the knowledge base.
        4.  Reset the input and force the user to try again immediately.
        5.  Log the failure as a "Risk" in the DB.

### 5. Curator Analytics
- **Dashboard:**
    - List of employees.
    - Status: "On Track" (Green) or "Needs Help" (Red - if they triggered Drill Mode > 3 times).
    - Button: "Nudge" (Mock action).

**Execution Plan for Agent:**
1.  **Setup:** Initialize Node/Express server and PostgreSQL connection.
2.  **Schema:** Run migrations for the tables.
3.  **Backend API:** Create endpoints for `auth`, `tracks/generate` (with AI mock), `tracks/join`, `progress/update`.
4.  **Frontend Core:** Setup Layout, Landing Page, and Auth.
5.  **The Player:** Build the step-by-step player with Framer Motion transitions.
6.  **Voice & Drill:** Integrate Web Speech API and the "Retry on Fail" logic.

**Refinement Instruction:**
Make the UI look expensive. Use subtle borders (`border-gray-200`), large blurry shadows (`shadow-xl`), and a very limited color palette (White bg, Black text, Deep Emerald Green for primary actions).

Start by setting up the server and database, then move to the Landing Page.
